                        If you're looking for a scenic and easy dog-friendly walk, the Estuary View Walk from Pen Cob car park is a lovely choice.
                        This 1¾-mile route takes you through the tranquil woodlands of Newborough Forest and alongside the Cefni Estuary, where there’s plenty of wildlife to spot along the way. Perfect for a more senior dog like Goonie. However, there are many trails to explore in Newborough, and there is plenty of choice. Check out the Natural Resources Wales website in our helpful links section for more information.

                        One of the highlights was the stunning views over the saltmarsh—a peaceful, untouched landscape that feels miles away from the hustle and bustle.
                        We enjoyed stopping at the two viewing points, keeping an eye out for an osprey hunting for fish in the summer sky.
                        The variety of plants was also a nice touch, including the towering common reed, which was once used for thatching.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The parking was convenient, making it easy to start the walk, but we did notice that there wasn’t much else to do nearby unless you had a car.
                        Unfortunately, our walk was somewhat disrupted by tree-clearing work after a storm, which meant there were some unexpected loud noises—not ideal when you’re hoping for a peaceful nature escape!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite that, it was still a lovely and relaxing walk, and if you’re a fan of wildlife, gentle trails, and estuary views, it’s well worth a visit.
                        Just check ahead for any maintenance work if you're looking for total tranquility!
                    </p>

            <h2>Difficulty<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
            <p>The Estuary View Walk is an easy, well-maintained trail, making it a great option for a relaxing stroll with your pup. The path meanders through Newborough Forest and follows the Cefni Estuary, offering scenic woodland and waterside views. While mostly flat, some sections may have uneven ground, so sturdy footwear is recommended.</p>

            <h2>Distance<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
            <p>This walk is 1¾ miles (2.9 kilometres) and typically takes around an hour at a leisurely pace. It’s an out-and-back route from Pen Cob car park, with two viewing points along the way. The trail is well-marked, but signage could be improved in some areas, so keeping a map handy is a good idea.</p>

            <h2>Terrain<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
            <p>The route consists of forest trails, compact gravel paths, and boardwalk sections. The estuary views are breathtaking, but be mindful of the tides if exploring closer to the water. After storms or high winds, tree-clearing operations may be in progress, which could cause some disruption.</p>

            <h2>Location<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
            <p>The Pen Cob car park is located near the village of Newborough, Anglesey. The nearest postcode is LL62 5BA, though this covers a broad area, so it's advisable to look out for local signage as you approach.
