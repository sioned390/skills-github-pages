                <p>Parys Mountain Mars on Earth</p>
                <p>Today, me and Goonie explored Parys Mountain, and what a walk it was! The landscape was absolutely breathtaking, unlike anywhere else we've been. The vibrant, copper-stained hills made us feel like we were walking on another planet, with shades of orange, red, and purple stretching as far as the eye could see.

                    There aren’t many facilities nearby—no toilets or cafés—so be sure to come prepared.</p>

                <p>The Walk</p>
                <p>Me and Goonie took the Main Trail (Approx. 2 miles) – A circular route that takes you around the historic mining landscape, with plenty of information boards about its 4,000-year-old mining history. The paths are mostly gravel and rocky, with some uneven spots, but easy enough for most walkers and adventurous pups.</p>

                <p>Parking</p>
                <p>You definitely need a car to get here, but once you do, the parking is great and free. It’s well worth the trip for the views alone!</p>

                <p>Places Naerby</p>
                <p>Amlwch Port – A historic harbour with plenty of space for a scenic walk.
                    Bull Bay to Cemaes Trail – A beautiful coastal path with stunning sea views.
                    The Local Cafés & Pubs – Many places in Amlwch welcome dogs, so we had plenty of options for a well-earned rest.</p>

                <p>Overall Verdict:</p>
                <p>We gave Parys Mountain a full 5 stars for its dramatic landscapes, peaceful trails, and fascinating history. Even without facilities, this place is truly one of a kind, and we’d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and dog-friendly adventure.</p>

                <h2>Difficulty<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p>Parys Mountain offers a variety of trails, all of which are moderate in difficulty due to uneven terrain and occasional steep sections. While there are clear paths, some areas have loose rocks and uneven ground, so sturdy footwear is recommended. Me and Goonie took the main circular trail, stopping to take in the breathtaking, otherworldly views of the colorful mining landscape.</p>

                <h2>Distance<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p>The main circular trail around Parys Mountain is approximately 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) and takes about an hour to complete at a steady pace. For those looking for a longer walk, there’s a 3-mile (4.8-kilometre) route that leads from Parys Mountain to Amlwch Port, offering a mix of historic mining landscapes and coastal views.</p>

                <h2>Terrain<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p>The trails consist of gravel paths, rocky tracks, and some exposed sections with little shelter. The ground can be uneven and loose in places, so care should be taken, especially after wet weather. Dogs should stay on the lead in certain areas, as there are open mineshafts and steep drops around the site.</p>

                <h2>Location<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p>For directions, enter "Parys Mountain, Amlwch" into your sat nav. The closest postcode is LL68 9RE, but as this covers a wider area, look out for signs as you approach. The Ordnance Survey (OS) grid reference for the car park is SH 438 892 (Explorer Map 263) Or head back to the map to view the address pin. There are no toilets or cafés nearby, so plan ahead, but the free parking and stunning views make this a must-visit!</p>
