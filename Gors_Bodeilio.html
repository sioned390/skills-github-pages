                <p>Gors Bodeilio – A tranquil wetland nature reserve</p>
                <p>filled with rare plants, dragonflies, and wading birds. This hidden gem offers peaceful walks through reedbeds and marshy grasslands, changing beautifully with the seasons and attracting nature lovers year-round. Perfect for a peaceful walk with your pup.</p>

                <p>The Walk from Pentraeth</p>
                <p>We started our walk from Pentraeth, which is local to us, following the backroads which is around 1.3 miles. When we reached Gors Bodeilio, the reserve is kitted with flat wooden boardwalks, nice and easy and also helpful to avoid the soggy wetland! Gors Bodeilio National Nature Reserve is a real hidden treasure on Anglesey. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle, this beautiful wetland is the perfect place for a quiet, scenic stroll, offering plenty of sights and sounds to enjoy along the way.</p>

                <p>Parking</p>
                <p>There is a small car park next to the gate entering the reserve which is free of charge. Luckily, we were the only ones there that day and had first pick. However, be mindful that in busier seasons there may be difficulty parking.</p>

                <p>Wild ponies!</p>
                <p>One of the highlights of our walk was spotting the wild ponies grazing in the distance – a magical and rare sight to see them so up close that made the experience feel extra special. The reserve is also home to an array of wildflowers and dragonflies, adding to the natural beauty of the landscape.</p>

                <p>Overall Verdict:</p>
                <p>This trail is a regular visit for me and Goonie and is fantastic for a short stroll to clear the mind. Although Goonie and I enjoy the quiet, Gors Bodeilio is very much secluded, and there are no nearby cafes or toilets, which is something to keep in mind on your visit and why we gave this walk a 4-star rating.</p>

                <h2>Difficulty<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p>Easy: There are two trails to choose from at Gors Bodeilio: the fen walk and the fen and meadow walk. Both are out-and-back walks and considered easy. Me and Goonie chose the fen walk, stopping to take in the views out across the reedbed and fens. Also, there are resting benches every 300 metres, making this trail accessible for most.</p>

                <h2>Distance<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p>The walk from Pentraeth to Gors Bodeilio is approximately 1.3 miles and typically takes us around an hour to reach the reserve. Once arrived, we took the fen walk which is ¾ mile (1.2 kilometres). There is also the fen meadow walk which is a little longer, 1½ miles (2.3 kilometres). Both trails are out-and-back to the car park.</p>

                <h2>Terrain<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p>The walking trail is mostly wooden boardwalk and gravel paths, all on the flat. But please bear in mind this walk is through a bog wetland and can be dangerous if you leave the path onto the marshland. If your pooch is particularly adventurous, make sure to keep them on a lead to avoid any sinking!</p>
