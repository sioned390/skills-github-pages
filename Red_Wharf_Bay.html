                        If you and your pup love wide-open beaches and scenic coastal views, then a walk along Red Wharf Bay is a must.
                        We started our journey from Pentraeth, following the shoreline towards the vast golden sands of the bay.
                        It’s an easy and peaceful walk, perfect for dogs who love to run free and explore—just be mindful of the tides,
                        as the beach stretches for miles at low tide but becomes much smaller when the water comes in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The scenery here is absolutely stunning, with endless sea views and a real sense of tranquility.
                        Along the way, we saw wading birds and salt marsh wildlife, making it a great spot for nature lovers.
                        The terrain is mostly firm sand, but there are some muddy patches, so decent footwear is a good idea.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There’s free parking right on the beach, which is super convenient.
                        While there are no toilet facilities, the beautiful surroundings and peaceful atmosphere more than make up for it.
                        After our walk, we stopped at The Boat House for a refreshing ice cream, which was the perfect way to round off the trip!
                        If you're looking for something more substantial, The Ship Inn and Tavern on the Bay are also great options for food and drinks with a view.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, this walk is a perfect mix of seaside serenity, natural beauty, and dog-friendly space,
                        making it an absolute five-star experience for both two-legged and four-legged adventurers!
                    </p>

            <h2>Difficulty<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
            <p>The Red Wharf Bay coastal walk is a gentle and easy-going route, perfect for a relaxed seaside stroll with your dog. The bay itself is a vast expanse of sandy shoreline, ideal for letting your pup stretch their legs, but bear in mind the tide times—at high tide, some paths may be limited. The walk is mostly flat, though some sections may be soft underfoot due to the sand.</p>

            <h2>Distance<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
            <p>The walk along Red Wharf Bay varies in length depending on your chosen route. A popular option is the walk from Pentraeth Beach to Red Wharf Bay, which is roughly 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) one way. You can extend your adventure by continuing towards Llanddona Beach for a longer coastal trek.</p>

            <h2>Terrain<i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
            <p>The route consists of firm sandy stretches, salt marshland, and some rocky areas near the water’s edge. At low tide, the bay reveals an enormous sandy plain, but the terrain can become muddy and slippery in places, so suitable footwear is recommended.</p>
